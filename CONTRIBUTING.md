# Contributing 

In order to have a concrete record that your contribution is intentional and you agree to license it under the same terms as the project's license, we've adopted the same lightweight approach that the Linux Kernel submitting patches process, Docker, and many other projects use: the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/), or DCO. This is a simple declaration that you wrote the contribution or otherwise have the right to contribute it to this project.

If you agree to this for your contribution, then all that's needed is to include the line in your commit or pull request comment:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.example.org>
```

We accept contributions under a legally identifiable name, such as your name on government documentation or common-law names (names claimed by legitimate usage or repute). Unfortunately, we cannot accept anonymous contributions at this time.

Git allows you to add this signoff automatically when using the `-s` flag to git commit, which uses the name and email set in your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs.
